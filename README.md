# Web Development Workshop 
Welcome to the Web Development Workshop. We will be using React, NodeJS and Socket IO to create a swiping poll web application.

# Prerequisites
* Install Git to your computer: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Install a text editing software such as VS Code / Notepad ++ / Sublime text etc
You can change the default text editor for git to the text editor of your choice: https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/associating-text-editors-with-git

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A text editor which we will be writing our code in.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Used to run our javascript code.

## Windows

A video of the setup process has been recorded for you if you get stuck. https://youtu.be/Yv-Se-KbFa8

### Visual Studio Code

- Download the windows installer from https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Run the installer once downloaded
- Follow the installation steps

## Node.js

- Download the windows LTS installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Run the installer once downloaded
- Follow the installation steps
- Open the windows command prompt (search for cmd)

We will use homebrew to install all of the software for mac. Install homebrew by pasting the following two commands into the terminal (spotlight and search for terminal).

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
```
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Visual Studio Code

- Run the following command in the terminal

```
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

### Node.js

- Run the following command in the terminal

```
brew install node
```

- Verify that node is installed by running `node --version`. The node version (e.g. v12.16.0) should be returned.

## This is the end of the pre-requisites! The steps below are for the practical, and you do NOT have to complete these right now (we'll go through them in the workshop)
